# Report a vulnerability on a Dorset HealthCare domain or subdomain

A vulnerability is a technical issue with this website or other internet facing infrastructure which attackers or hackers could use to exploit the organisation, its website or its users.

This policy covers all internet facing websites and infrastructure belonging to Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust.

You will not be paid a reward for reporting a vulnerability (known as a 'bug bounty').

## How to report a vulnerability

Include in your report:

* the IP address and/or URL of the page where you found the vulnerability;
* a description of the type of vulnerability, for example, XSS vulnerability;
* details of any steps we need to take to reproduce the vulnerability;
* screenshots or logs if you have them.

Report a vulnerability by email: **dhc.it.security@nhs.net**

## Guidelines for reporting a vulnerability

When you are investigating and reporting a vulnerability on a Dorset HealthCare domain or subdomain, you must not:

* break the law;
* access unnecessary or excessive amounts of data;
* modify data;
* use high intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities;
* attempt denial of service attacks or otherwise overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests;
* disrupt our services or systems;
* tell other people about the vulnerability you have found until we have disclosed it;
* social engineer, phish or physically attack our staff or infrastructure;
* demand money to disclose a vulnerability.

You can also email us to report:

* non exploitable vulnerabilities;
* something you think could be improved;
* TLS configuration weaknesses.

## Data protection

You must follow [data protection rules](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection) when investigating or reporting a vulnerability. This means that you cannot share any data you might retrieve from our sites when researching the vulnerability.

You must keep the data secure until you delete it. You must delete the data as soon as we no longer need it.

## After you've reported the vulnerability

We will contact you to acknowledge your report and will keep you periodically updated. We will try to assess your report within ten working days. We will prioritise the resolution of vulnerabilities by impact, severity and exploit complexity.

One the vulnerability has been resolved, we can work with you to disclose and publish the report if necessary.
