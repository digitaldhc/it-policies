# Antivirus policy

## Summary

1.  The Trust has a responsibility to uphold the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data held within its IT systems. The prevalence of malware and viruses presents an ongoing threat to the Trust’s operation which can be substantially mitigated through the installation and use of antivirus software.   
 

2.  The Trust therefore expects that computers be protected by antivirus software that is adequate for the purpose and is correctly monitored and managed. 

## Definitions

1.  EDR – endpoint detection and response – software that is used to collect and interpret security logs from endpoints and generate alerts in response to events of interest or the detection of potential threat conditions. EDR systems can use behavioural sensors, threat intelligence and security analytics to prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. 


## Scope

1.  In scope - this policy applies to:  

-   all Trust owned computers including, but not limited to, desktop and laptop computers, physical servers and virtual servers whether hosted locally or remotely; 

-   third party computer systems that have the capability to run antivirus software.   
 

2.  Out of scope - this policy does not apply to: 

-   NHSmail, including the national shared Microsoft tenant; 

-   the Trust’s clinical systems, where these are hosted remotely or provided on a software-as-a-service basis; 

-   other software-as-a-service systems, where the provision and management of antivirus is the responsibility of the service provider. 


## Policy

1.  The Trust must adopt and maintain a standard suite of antivirus software. This includes, but is not limited to, antivirus and EDR products for both endpoint and server devices.   
 
2.  Endpoint and server devices should use antivirus software from different vendors to provide additional defence-in-depth capabilities.   
 
3.  Additionally, server devices must be specifically protected against encrypting ransomware, either through the inherent capabilities of the antivirus software or through another product.   
 
4.  All in-scope devices must be protected by the Trust’s standard antivirus software, which must be active and kept up-to-date at all times.   
 
5.  EDR software should collect and interpret logs and security events from the Trust’s endpoint and server devices, and generate and present security alerts when events of interest occur.   
 
6.  All in-scope devices must be monitored by the Trust’s standard EDR software.   
 
7.  Any in-scope third party system that is not managed by the Trust but is authorised to be connected to any of the Trust’s networks must be protected by adequate antivirus software, the responsibility of the system owner.   
 
8.  Antivirus software must be configured to run regular scans for viruses and malware.   
 
9.  Antivirus software should also be configured to enforce on-access scanning. Where this is not desirable, on-access scanning should only be disabled through the use of specific exceptions.   
 
10. The Trust may monitor devices on its network to ensure the presence of adequate antivirus software, and that it is active, correctly configured, and up-to-date. The Trust reserves the right to deny network access to devices that do not comply with this policy.   
 
11. Staff must not under any circumstances attempt to inhibit, tamper with, or alter the configuration of installed antivirus software.   
 
12. The Trust will periodically review the security software it has in place to ensure best fit with the requirements of the organisation.   
 

## Roles and responsibilities

1.  The senior information risk owner (SIRO) is accountable for the management and acceptance of information risk.   
 
2.  The chief information officer (CIO) is accountable for ensuring that IT systems are managed in accordance with the Trust’s policies.    

3.  The head of IT infrastructure is responsible for the correct running of the Trust’s IT infrastructure, that it is maintained in an appropriate and secure manner and that the provision, installation and management of antivirus software is carried out in accordance
with this policy. This responsibility is delegated to senior infrastructure engineers and their specialist technical teams.   
 
4.  The IT security team manage the IT security workplan. They provide advice on security matters and appropriate measures to address risk, and coordinate with specialist technical teams to gather and provide assurance in accordance with this policy.   
 
5.  All Dorset HealthCare staff are responsible for using their Trust-issued device in accordance with published acceptable use policies.
